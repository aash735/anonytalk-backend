                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>I failed my entrance exam three times. Everyone around me had moved on—friends were in college, living their dreams, while I felt stuck in an endless loop of disappointment. My parents tried to hide their worry, but I could see it in their eyes. I started believing I wasn't good enough, that maybe success just wasn't meant for me.</p>
                        <p>Then one day, while sitting alone in my room, I realized something: I had been chasing a dream that wasn't even mine. I was trying to become someone else's version of success. So I stopped. I took a break, explored what I actually loved, and discovered a passion for design. Today, I'm a freelance designer, building a career I never knew I wanted but absolutely love. Those three failures? They were redirections, not dead ends.</p>

                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>At 26, I had switched jobs four times. Each time, I thought "this is it," and each time, I felt more lost than before. People around me seemed so sure of their paths, while I was drowning in confusion and self-doubt. I felt like a failure, like I was wasting my life jumping from one thing to another without direction.</p>
                        <p>What I didn't realize then was that I wasn't lost—I was exploring. Each job taught me what I didn't want, and slowly, through all that trial and error, I discovered what truly made me feel alive. Now, at 29, I finally found my place. It took time, it took courage, and it took accepting that not knowing is part of the journey. If you're feeling lost right now, trust that you're finding your way.</p>

                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>There was a time when I felt invisible. Friends were busy, family didn't understand what I was going through, and I convinced myself that no one cared. I spent nights crying, feeling like I was carrying this unbearable weight alone. I started withdrawing, thinking it was easier to be alone than to feel unwanted.</p>
                        <p>But then I reached out. Just once. I sent a message to an old friend, not expecting much. And they replied. We talked for hours. I realized that people do care—they just don't always know you're struggling. That one conversation reminded me that connection is still possible, even when it feels impossible. You're not alone. Even in your darkest moment, there's someone who would want to be there for you. Sometimes, you just have to let them in.</p>

                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>I used to be confident. Then life happened—rejections, failures, heartbreaks—and slowly, I stopped believing in myself. I became my own worst critic, constantly replaying every mistake, every harsh word someone said to me. I forgot what it felt like to feel capable, to feel worthy.</p>
                        <p>Recovery didn't happen overnight. It started with small things—getting out of bed, finishing one task, saying one kind thing to myself. Slowly, those small wins added up. I started journaling, celebrating tiny victories, reminding myself that I've survived 100% of my worst days. Today, I'm rebuilding my confidence, one step at a time. If you've lost faith in yourself, know this: you are still capable, still worthy, still enough. You just need to remember.</p>
